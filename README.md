# Whats Next?

Whats Next is a tool that was developed to try and help myself organize the information from all of my classes better. I started out using a spreadsheet with multiple pages, one for each class, and as I added more items it would get messy. I also had a 'kanban' board page where I could track all of the work that I needed to do.

My goal is to make a single location where I can easily see the classes I am taking. Each page would have any relavent links (like to the Syllabus, Zoom links, or homework sites), as well as any notes I have on the class, such as meeting times.

The other goal is to setup an interactive kanban board to track classes, similar to Github's for managing pull requests and issues.

## Technologies

* Angular - Frontend Javascript framework
* Docker - Development environment and deployment

## Web

The website portion of this project was built as a PWA. I made this decision as I wanted the website to be highly responsive as well as work offline.

I used docker as a development environment to make life easier as well as making things highly portable.

## Database
